Extract the tweets of Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump). Analyze his tweeting style by visualization. Specifically, we find that the [work](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) by David Robinson inspiring. Based on his conclusion, we move further to analyze Trump himself's twitting style.

## Data Description
By [twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api), we use [Tweepy](http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/) to get the tweeters of a single user. Details of data set are in the [data book](databook.pdf)


### Data Acquirement

As one of the most popular social platform in the world, Twitter provides developers with powerful API to acquire and analyze tweet data. In this project, we use Python module TweepyÂ to get data from twitter API.
Since Twitter API is protected by OAuth(unlike the fully opened API we have worked with in class), we firstly registered a twitter development account and get the authorized key and secret from twitter and then get the tweets data from web. Considering the efficiency and interpretation of data, we only extracted interested data(details see in databook). Also, because of the constraint of the API, only the most recent 3200 tweets of one user are available so the size of our dataset is around 3200 and dated back to around Trump's tweet in 2016-3-27.

### Visualization
